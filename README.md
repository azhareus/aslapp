- **Category:** Communications / Education / Travel
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but can be ported to other platforms in the future, as the functionality of the app and the libraries used are adaptable to other devices and development cycles.
- **Story:** The user will have primarily two modes of functionality: learning and translation. In learning mode, the user will be given prompts to translate and test their fluency in the selected language, as well as test their understanding with multiple-choice questions. In translation mode, the user will be able to leverage the app to translate the selected language in real-time and caption ASL.
- **Market:** This app is open to any individual with no age restriction.
- **Habit:** This app can be used as frequently as the user would like to for education or practical purposes.
- **Scope:** Initially, the app will be built around the necessity for accessibility of translation, but in a future state we would like to cultivate a community for learning and immersive traveling experiences through the power of live translations. Integrating with businesses to better equip them to serve the hearing/speaking impaired by improving accessibility through technology. Kiosks/Android tablets with the software integrated to assist in retail locations.
